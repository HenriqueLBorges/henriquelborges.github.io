title: About me 
---

I have always loved to interact with technology. When I was younger the main form of interaction was through games, but as I grew older I started to follow a path that would ultimately leads me to a computer engeering course, although I have never lost interest in games.

My first contact with software not written by big companies and sold as products was through emulators. Even now I remeber my reactions after seen pok√©mon running in a gameboy emulator. I guess it also started a will of learn a programming language.

I remember trying to learn Python but it always felt odd. The difference between printing a message into terminal and reproduce a GBA game into my computer always felt huge. And the big question to me was, if my "code" needs this interpreter to be installed into an operational system, then I'm not really coding, the guys who actually built the interpreter and the operational system are the real developers.

At college I learned about algorithms and from start, it didn't feel natural to me. But I guess most in life is about persistence and after lists and lists of exercises I got it right. At this point I started my personal philosophy about algorithms, I will try, fail and learn how to solve every problem with code (this later evolved to solve it in a good way).

Even after I got pretty good at solving problems, I didn't feel capable of writing a whole application. The two main reasons were, I have never worked professionally as a programmer before and I was not aware that everything in technology was powered by colaboration.

Starting to writing code professionally was a big step to me, it put me directly in contact with people that were relying on my work, criticizing it and teaching me new things. From this point, I have always chosen oportunities where I felt I could improve myself and my work.

Nowadays I feel confortable enough on sharing my thoughts and also share knowledge with others. This is the main reason why I started a blog.
