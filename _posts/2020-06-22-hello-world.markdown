This is my first blog post, kind of expected that I would start this with a "Hello world" reference. I'm willing to share here all I have experienced from success to failure, and maybe this will be useful to anyone.

{% highlight python %}
def post(message):
  print(message)

post('First hello world!')
{% endhighlight %}

Hope you enjoy ;)
